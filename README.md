### Professional Self-Assessment

I started my Computer Science journey in 2023 and was hooked from the first Introduction to Scripting course. I’ve picked up multiple languages through this program, including Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, and Kotlin. Courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics have honed my logic and problem-solving abilities. I’ve learned about software development lifecycles, including AGILE methodology, how systems are designed and analyzed, and how software developers collaborate effectively with one another, stakeholders, and end-users. I’ve become familiar with securing software through encryption and secure communications, and testing software using tools such as JUnit and Postman. Through my Mobile Architecture & Programming and Full Stack Development courses, I have created fully functional full-stack and mobile applications.

### Artifact 1: CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming Inventory App

[Repository link](https://github.com/AnthonyAmbs/Capstone-Inventory-App)


My Inventory App artifact is an Android app, developed in Android Studio using JavaScript with a SQLite database. It was designed for businesses to manage and monitor their inventory. The app handles user registration and login, as well as CRUD operations for inventory items. I used my Inventory App artifact for both my Software Design and Engineering enhancement and my Database enhancement. For my Software Design and Engineering enhancement, I converted the app from JavaScript to Kotlin. This was my first time working with Kotlin, and although there was somewhat of a learning curve, I find each programming language easier to learn than the last. I also implemented password hashing through jBCrypt. For my Databases enhancement, I converted from SQLite to MongoDB. I developed a node.js api to facilitate secure HTTPS communications between the app and the database.   

Through implementing tools to better the app, increasing security, and understandable code comments, these enhancements fulfilled the following course outcomes:

* Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.  

* Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.

* Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.
  

### Artifact 2: CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms Binary Search Tree

[Repository link](https://github.com/AnthonyAmbs/Capstone-Red-Black-Tree)

My Binary Search Tree loaded courses, consisting of course ID, course name, and prerequisite courses, from a .csv file and inserted them into a binary search tree. I used this artifact for my Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement by converting it to a red-black tree. Unlike a binary search tree, a red-black tree self-balances, preventing performance degradation from skewed trees. This means the worst-case performance goes from being linear O(N) to logarithmic log(N). 

By increasing software efficiency by implementing a better technique, this enhancement fulfilled the following course outcomes: 

* Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.  

* Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
