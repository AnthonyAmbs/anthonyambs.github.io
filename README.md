### Artifact 1: CS 360 Mobile Architecture and Programming Inventory App

[Repository link](https://github.com/AnthonyAmbs/Capstone-Inventory-App)


My Inventory App artifact is an Android app, developed in Android Studio using JavaScript with a SQLite database. It was designed for businesses to manage and monitor their inventory. The app handles user registration and login, as well as CRUD operations for inventory items. I used my Inventory App artifact for both my Software Design and Engineering enhancement and my Database enhancement. For my Software Design and Engineering enhancement, I converted the app from JavaScript to Kotlin. This was my first time working with Kotlin, and although there was somewhat of a learning curve, I find each programming language easier to learn than the last. I also implemented password hashing through jBCrypt. For my Databases enhancement, I converted from SQLite to MongoDB. I developed a node.js api to facilitate secure HTTPS communications between the app and the database.   


### Artifact 2: CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms Binary Search Tree

[Repository link](https://github.com/AnthonyAmbs/Capstone-Red-Black-Tree)

My Binary Search Tree loaded courses, consisting of course ID, course name, and prerequisite courses, from a .csv file and inserted them into a binary search tree. I used this artifact for my Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement by converting it to a red-black tree. Unlike a binary search tree, a red-black tree self-balances, preventing performance degradation from skewed trees. This means the worst-case performance goes from being linear O(N) to logarithmic log(N).
